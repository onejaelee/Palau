## Background
Changes in ocean temperature are one of the most important measures of long-term global climate change.  Ocean temperature is an indicator of the state of marine ecosystems, as surface and subsurface variations surface can influence species distribution, growth, and life span, alter their migration and breeding patterns, and threaten sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs.

## Indicator: Mean Sea Surface Temperature
SST is probably one of the most well-known and widely observed climate indicators2.  SST is used to monitor human-forced climate change and modes of  natural climate variability that affect patterns of wind and rain as well as ocean circulation, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO)/Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)3,4.  The Physical Sciences Division at NOAA produces an SST product based on optimum interpolation (OI) analysis.  The product, NOAA OISSTv25,6,7  is produced weekly on a one-degree grid. Monthly averages are used here.  The temporal coverage of the monthly data used is from January 1982 through December 2021.    
The observed trend at each 1-degree grid point, in oC per decade, is shown in Figure 19.  Almost all Pacific Island countries have experienced warming during this period.  Hawaii, Niue and Tonga have all experienced at least 0.2 oC (0.4°F) per decade warming, while most other countries have experience warming between 0.1 and 0.2 °C (0.2 to 0.4°F) per decade.  The southeastern part, around the Marquesas is a notable exception.  Here, temperatures show cooling trends over the period 1982-2021.

The trends throughout the observation period vary from decade to decade, primarily due to increased ENSO activity during some decades compared to others.  For example, the 1990’s saw 4 El Niño events with two very strong ones (1991/92 and 1997/98).  The decade ended with a big La Niña event.  SST trends in this decade would likely show cooling due to this shift from warm to cold (see Figure 20).

This is reflected in the average SST anomalies (departures from the 1981 to 2020 seasonal means) computed over the boreal winter months (December, January, February; DJF) for each decade.  Figure 20 shows the mean DJF SST anomalies for each decade, with the 1990’s being mostly neutral (balance of warm and cold events during the decade), and the 2010’s showing more like La Niña conditions.

## Indicator: Marine Heat Waves
Marine heatwaves are episodes of much higher than normal ocean temperatures that persist from between 5 days to many months. The sea surface temperature threshold that signifies a marine heatwave is the 90th percentile, which is the highest 10% of sea surface temperatures experienced on a given day that is determined by looking at many years of data8.  When the 90th percentile temperature is exceeded for five or more consecutive days, the event is referred to as a marine heatwave.  Marine heatwave intensity is characterized by four categories (Moderate; Strong; Severe; Extreme)9.  Marine heatwaves can occur year-round.  The western tropical Pacific is a global hotspot for increase in marine heatwaves.

Marine heatwaves can have ecological impacts, ranging from coral bleaching, lagoon health, seagrass and mangrove die-off, fisheries and aquaculture, impacting economies and livelihoods in the Pacific. Impacts depend on the severity, duration, extent and timing of marine heatwave. As an example of a short duration high impact event, in February of 2016 Fiji experienced a marine heatwave that only lasted about two weeks, but due to its rapid onset and high severity caused significant fish die off in lagoons due to reduced dissolved oxygen in the water as a result of extreme temperatures.  Conversely in some instances, impacts only arise from marine heatwaves if they persist over many months. An example from 2015 occurred in the waters around Kiritimati Island in the Kiribati Line Islands when a long-duration event was driven in part by the El Niño event occurred that year. The result was significant coral bleaching and mortality, as the event did not subside in time for the corals to recover.

Daily SST data from satellite and in situ observations are available from 1st September 1981, providing the opportunity to assess the history of marine heatwaves in the Pacific over almost 40 years. Marine heatwave summaries showing frequency of events, maximum severity, and average duration in each decade since 1981 are shown in Figure 21.

  __Figure 21__. Marine Heat Wave Summaries.  Daily NOAA OISSTv2.1 SST data (Huang et al. 2021) for 1981-2020 were ingested into  a marine heatwave algorithm to calculate number of marine heatwave (MH) events (top row), maximum severity9 (middle row) and median duration (bottom row) . The climatology period was set from 1981 to 2010 for calculation of the 90th percentile threshold. Summaries are split into decadal periods.
</p>

The number of marine heatwaves remained fairly constant in the tropical regions in the 1980s and 1990s, with around 10 to 15 events per decade in the western Pacific and up to 30 events per decade in the east. Compared to the 1980s, the northwest Pacific had an increase in the frequency of events in the 1990s to about 30. In the 2000s, numbers decreased within the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and increased in the eastern Pacific and subtropics to approximately 40 events. The 2010s had the highest number of events, reaching above 50 in the Western Warm Pool, a band spanning from PNG to the central Pacific, and off the coast of Mexico.

The maximum marine heatwave severity near the equator occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, reaching the Extreme category. Most of the remainder of the Pacific reached the Strong category, with pockets of Severe in the tropics, and Moderate in the subtropics. The central and western equatorial Pacific showed a decrease in maximum severity in the 2000s, reaching only Moderate, with mostly Strong severity in the remainder of the region. The 2010s increased in maximum marine heatwave severity just north of the equator, and in the southern subtropical region.

The average duration of marine heatwaves is consistent for the three decades from the 1980s to 2000s, with much of the Pacific region within the 5- to 16-day range. However, there is a noticeable increase in event duration in the 2010s, with most of the Pacific in the 8 to 20+ day range.

## Indicator: Subsurface Temperature
Ocean temperature integrated over a given depth range provide estimates of oceanic heat content.  This is an important parameter as the ocean sequesters much of the increased atmospheric heat from anthropogenic processes. Ocean temperature is integrated over the upper 300 meters of the ocean and then a linear fit is applied to the result from 1981 to 2018. The result (Figure 22) gives an indication of the trends in oceanic heat content (H300) during this period. Trends over this period are expected to be affected by both human-forced global warming and natural climate variability.
Trends in heat content over the 38-year period are largely positive in the Western Warm Pool region and in the northern and southern sub-tropics, indicating the ocean is absorbing and retaining more heat in these regions. Highest trends are found in western PNG, Solomon Islands, Nauru, and Tokelau. Slightly negative trends are found in the eastern Pacific just north and south of the equator.
